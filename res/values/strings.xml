    <string name="tutorial0">Welcome to this tutorial !\nWWII is a heavy tactical real-time strategy game. We\'ll see here how to lead your troops to victory.</string>
    <string name="tutorial1">There are 2 ways to win a game in WWII : either you <u>destroy</u> the whole army of your opponent or you can win by <u>conquering</u> all the Strategic Points of the map.\nThese are randomly placed in players\' deployment zones when the battle starts.</string>
    <string name="tutorial2">Let\'s start playing ! You can navigate through the map by sweeping the screen with one finger; you can also zoom in/ zoom out by pinching the screen.</string>
    <string name="tutorial3">You can give 4 different orders to your units :\nMove, Fire, Hide and Defend orders.</string>
    <string name="tutorial4"><u>Touch and Drag</u> a unit to another location on the battlefield to give a <u>Move Order</u>.\nWhile dragging the unit, you\'ll see a Shield icon appearing if the Move Order destination gives any sort of protection.</string>
    <string name="tutorial5">If you target an enemy unit while giving an order to a unit, the order line will go from green to black, if no line of sight to reach the target, or red if you can shoot on it.\nThe distance label color will also be updated based on the chance to hit the target.\nBlack = no chance, Green = best chances.</string>
    <string name="tutorial6">When the battle starts all your soldiers are given <u>Hide orders</u> and your vehicles <u>Defend orders</u>. \nTo give a Hide order, just tap on a unit previously selected. If you tap on it again it will switch to a Defend order.\nWhile having Hide orders, your units will be harder to localize, and will stay ambush until enemy units are close enough. With a Defend order, a unit will shoot at any enemy unit it sees.</string>
    <string name="tutorial7">Let\'s now have a look at a selected unit information layout !\nFirst line contains the name, the experience (no medal = recruit, 1 medal = veteran, 2 medals = elite) and the hauts-faits counter.\nThen, you have the weapons with their anti-personal and anti-tank efficiencies and the amount of ammo left.\nLast line contains the current action of the unit.</string>
    <string name="tutorial8">In WWII, the units are behaving like real human beings. Units under fire will hide themselves and will sometimes not be able to react. Less-experienced units will panic more than experienced ones. Before shooting, a unit will have to aim, and reload its weapon if needed. Units will adjust their firing speed depending on the amount of ammo left.</string>
    <string name="tutorial9">Vehicles and tanks are powerful but expensive and less maneuverable units. Keep in mind that sides and rear of vehicles are more vulnerable. On short distance, vehicles can reverse. Watch out your troops, vehicles can run over soldiers. Vehicles can fire with their secondary weapon while moving.</string>
    <string name="tutorial10">Using the terrain covers is one of the keys to success.\nBushes do not block line of sights but provide light protections.\nTrees, fields and houses block line of sights and are giving medium to high covers to your soldiers.</string>
    <string name="tutorial11">This tutorial is now finished.\nTry to seek and destroy the 2 enemy riflemen on the map.\nGood luck !</string>

        \nAfter the successes encountered in the Normandy Breakout from July through August 1944, it was believed that the German Army was a beaten foe and in retreat.
        \nAs such, British General Montgomery lay forth a brazen plan to capture key bridges that would be required conquests for the final push into Germany, perhaps ending the war in Europe by Christmas of 1944.
        \nMontgomery relayed his plan and, following acceptance by Supreme Allied Commander in Europe - US General Dwight Eisenhower - put the plan into action.
        \nOn September 17th - just seven days after the official approval, Operation Market Garden was set in motion&#8230;</string>
